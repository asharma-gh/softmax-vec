# softmax-vec
Vectorized Softmax implementation in Python

A very basic Softmax multi-class classifier implementation using `numpy`, based in part using Andrew Ng's coursera courses.

Everything is setup so running `main.py` will execute my custom Softmax implementation on the `MNIST` dataset for binary handwritten digit classification.

An additional tensor flow implementation is included for comparison with `tf_impl()`.
